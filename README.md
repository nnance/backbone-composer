# Composer

Is a minimal, slightly opinionated Backbone plugin to simplify view rendering and life cycle management.  The plugin goals include:
* Minimize boilerplate view code
* Manage view life cycle to minimize memory leaks
* Simplify the management of child views / subviews
* Restore the state of the DOM after re-rendering

## Getting Started

Install with bower.  If you haven't used [bower](#http://bower.io) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://bower.io/#getting-started) guide, as it explains how to install Bower and install bower packages. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:
```
bower install backbone.composer --save
```
